Problem

Find the number of primes possible which follows the following three conditions :

a) Can be expressed as a sum of squares of two integers x and y i.e. x^2 +y^2= prime.
b) Lies between two integers (not necessarily prime numbers) P and Q.
c) Two integers Z and A exists such that (x^y) % Z = A.

Input:
No. of test cases = t
For each test case, input
P Q Z A

e.g.

2
12 102 7 1
134 194 3 1

Output:
2
5

Limits:
0<=P<100000000
0<Q<=100000000
0<Z<=9999999
0<=A<9999999
